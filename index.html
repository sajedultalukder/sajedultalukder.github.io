            I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.uab.edu/cas/computerscience/">The University of Alabama at Birmingham</a>. I direct the <a href="supremelab/index.html"><b>S</b>ec<b>u</b>rity and <b>Pr</b>ivacy <b>E</b>nhanced <b>M</b>achine L<b>e</b>arning (SUPREME) Lab</a>, where my group develops privacy-enhanced secure systems with machine learning applications. I am also a member of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uab.edu/cas/thecenter/" rel="noopener noreferrer">UAB Center for Cyber Security</a>. My current <a href="research.html">research interests</a> include security and privacy with applications in online and geosocial networks, machine learning, wireless networks, distributed systems, and mobile applications. Widely cited in books and research papers, my research has been funded by leading federal agencies like National Science Foundation (NSF), Cyber Florida, Florida Center for Cybersecurity, etc. I am the recipient of the prestigious <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2153482&HistoricalAwards=false"><b>2022 NSF CISE CRII award</b></a> by the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) under the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program. I am also the recipient of the 2022 <a href="https://news.siu.edu/2022/06/063022-Two-SIU-researchers-receive-grants-to-improve-manufacturing.php"><b>Illinois Manufacturing Excellence Center (IMEC) award</b></a>. I am the nominee of the PennWest's <b>Scholar of the Year</b> in 2020 and SIU's <b>University-Level Early Career Faculty Excellence Award</b> in 2022.<br><br>
            I have been working on Security & Privacy and Machine Learning for the last ten years, leading to numerous publications and book chapters. My research has been published in reputed journals and top CS conferences including ACM TSC, Nature Scientific Reports, ACM SAC, ICWSM, ACM CHI, ACM WebSci, and has received media attention from many news outlets including prominent national and international outlets. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQhJiwM0t7U">NBC 6</a> has featured my research as a sweeps prime-time story and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FVasRF7XAg">Sage Research Methods</a> based on UK has made my research methods available to academic libraries for subscription or purchase aimed at helping students and early career researchers. I am the recipient of many research travel grants and have been invited by <a href="https://research.fb.com/">Facebook Research</a> to their HQ. My paper has won best paper award on multiple occasions. I am a member of IEEE and ACM, and serving on the editorial boards and program committees in numerous prestigious conferences and journals including ACM Asian Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS), IEEE International Conference on Networking Systems and Security, IEEE Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC), EAI International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Systems (SecureComm), ACM CCSC, Big Data and Cognitive Computing (BDCC), Applied Sciences Journal and ACL Workshop on Abusive Language Online. I have mentored over thirty students, including K-12 high school teachers, undergraduate students, and graduate students in several programs, such as Science without Borders’s Summer Research Program, NSF’s Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), and NSF’s Research Experience for Teachers (RET). Before joining UAB, I was a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Computer Science at SIU Carbondale and prior to that at PennWest, where I led their Cybersecurity programs.
